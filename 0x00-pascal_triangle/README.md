# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row. This concept is used widely in probability, combinatorics, and algebra.


## Interview Task

Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n:

Returns an empty list if n <= 0
You can assume n will be always an integer

NOTE: n is the number of row in Pascal Triangle

```bash
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
0-main
"""
pascal_triangle = __import__('0-pascal_triangle').pascal_triangle

def print_triangle(triangle):
    """
    Print the triangle
    """
    for row in triangle:
        print("[{}]".format(",".join([str(x) for x in row])))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_triangle(pascal_triangle(5))
```
